## Project Description
We have been assigned to code a Mastermind game in python using collaboration tools JIRA and Git. 

## Rules
Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players. One player becomes the codemaker, the other the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four colors and hides it. The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within twelve turns. Once guessed, the codemaker provides feedback for the guess, red symbol feedback means the color and the position are correct, white symbol feedback represents color is correct but in wrong position and X represents neither of these are correct for the guess. The codebreaker tries to guess in least tries as possible.

## Workflow
We designed and assigned our tasks in JIRA, created a flowchart to have the high level overview and started coding in collaboration afterwards.

## Organization
We worked remotely on google colab for the coding part, and used zoom for communication. Since it is a small project coding has been done simultaneously on google colab.
